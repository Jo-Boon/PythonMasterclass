    "# Object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main strenghts of Python is that it supports object-oriented programming (OOP), although it is not unique in that sense: most codes are built around that concept these days. When writing complex programs, or when developing Python packages or libraries, an object-oriented approach is the way to go. An object has unique properties and behaviour. Its properties are defined through *attributes* and the *methods* of an object determine its behaviour. Once an object is defined, you can use it mulitple times in your program, which has the obvious advantage that you don't have to repeat the same code over and over again. By letting objects interact with each other, you define how your program works.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are not used to this type of programming, OOP may seem like an abstract concept, and it is best explained by showing examples. But before we can do that, we have to talk about functions first."

    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code that performs a specific taks and is only executed when it is called from somewhere else inside your program. You typically create functions when certain tasks have to be executed several times. So as a general rule, when you're programming and you find that you are repeating the same lines of code twice or more, then it is time to think about bundling them into a function. This leaves less room for errors and it makes your code much easier to read and understand. Moreover, it is less work to change the function than it is to change the code in all the places where repetition occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code block below demonstrates how a function is defined. The first line starts with `def`, which tells Python that you plan to define a function. After `def` comes the name of the function, followed by parentheses. In this example, the word `name` appears between parentheses, meaning that the function `describe_person` accepts an *argument*, which in this case is called `name`. Effectively, `name` is a variable that will be available inside (and only inside) the function. Note that the line with the function definition must end with a colon, and that all code that belongs to the function must be indented."

    "That worked! Or did it? Is the square root of 10 really 3? Well, almost but what happened here is that NumPy rounded the result of the `sqrt` function to the nearest whole number. Why would it do that, since it is clearly wrong?! The answer has to do with variable types. In this case we passed 10, which is an integer. The number got converted to an array with NumPy's `atleast_1d` function, from which the array with the return values was derived using the `empty_like` function. Because the function's input argument `x` was an integer, both arrays end up being integer arrays and the numbers they contain will remain integers, even when you assign a float to an element.\n",

    "In Python classes form the blueprint for the structure and behaviour of objects. A class has properties (also called attributes) and methods, as shown in the code cell below. The definition of a class starts (not surprisingly) with the word `class`, which is followed by its name (and a colon to end the code line). \n",
    "\n",
    "All code that defines the class is indented. In the example below, two functions are defined as part of the class (and therefore they should rather be called methods). The first one is `__init__`, which is the method that gets executed when an object gets initialized (more on that later). It can be seen that there are four arguments: `self`, `name`, `age` and `nationality`. The argument `self` is a bit of a special one. It occurs because the object needs to know about its own existence in the computer memory. A user doesn't have to worry about `self`, the argument gets passed to the function invisibly by Python, so as far as the user is concerned, there are really only three arguments for the function (`name`, `age` and `nationality`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the `__init__` method, the arguments are used to set the properties of the class. These are `_name`, `_age` and `_nationality`. Because the are preceded by `self`, we know that they are properties of the class. The leading underscore is there because there is a convention in Python that if a variable is not supposed to be modified by the user, its name receives a leading underscore. That is not to say that the user can't change it (there is nothing that prevents them from doing this) but at least they've been warned not to touch it, as otherwise unexpected behaviour might occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method is a simple function that prints a message to the screen depending on the state (i.e. the values of the properties) of the object. Notice that the word `self` appears once more as an argument, simply because Python requires it because we are defining a class. In practice, the function gets called without any arguments, as will be demonstrated in the next code cell."

    "With these classes define, we can also change the way the `Course` class works. Rather than having to pass `role` as a keyword argument, we can let the method decide to which of the two lists, `_attendees` or `_instructors`, the person needs to be assigned. For this purpose, Python has the function `isinstance`, which checks if a variable is an instance of a certain class."
